Overview
This course presents an in-depth study of cryptography and its applications to information and computer security. It serves as an introduction to modern cryptography, emphasizing its classical goals: data privacy, authenticity, and integrity. It covers the fundamentals of both symmetric-key and public-key cryptography. Additionally, the course introduces advanced cryptography concepts, including commitment schemes, secret sharing, oblivious transfer, zero-knowledge proofs, and multi-party computation.

Privacy and security are central to our emerging “information society”, and cryptography is a key technology for achieving them; it is also a fascinating field of study in its own right. Cryptography lies at the center of this course, but we will be approaching the subject broadly. On the one end, we’ll look at problems of computer and information security and see how cryptographic tools can be used to solve them. We’ll also touch on some social issues surrounding the use of cryptography. At the other end, we’ll explore the mathematical structures from which cryptographic primitives are built, and learn how to use some of these techniques in real-world scenarios.

Information security, broadly defined, involves controlling the dissemination of information. It includes issues of privacy, data integrity, authenticity, and authority. Because of the ease with which information can be copied and transmitted, traditional physical means of control are of limited efficacy. Cryptography gives a way to build logical controls on the flow of information that are largely independent of the physical properties of the devices used to transmit and store information. In addition to this, while we may rely on cryptography for access control and protection of sensitive data, computer security also includes topics such as physical security, access restrictions, activity monitoring, and control of software defects that go way beyond what will be covered in this course.

Broadly, we will cover:

Symmetric key cryptography: Symmetric Key Encryption, Pseudorandom number generators (PRG), Pseudorandom functions (PRF), Stream ciphers, Block ciphers, Modes of Operations, Security definitions for Encryption, Message integrity, Message authentication codes, Hash Functions.
Public key cryptography: Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, Discrete Logarithm Problem. Public key encryption, Security definitions, Factoring Problem, ElGamal  Encryption, RSA Encryption. Digital Signatures, RSA Signature, DSA Signature. Introduction to Elliptic Curve, ECDSA Signature.  
Applications: Public key infrastructure (PKI), Brief Introduction to TLS.
Advanced Cryptography Concepts: Commitment Schemes, Secret Sharing, Oblivious Transfer, Zero knowledge Proofs, Multiparty Computation.
Learning Outcomes
You will have a solid understanding of the mathematical tools for cryptography; symmetric and public key cryptographic techniques as DES, RSA, and zero-knowledge proofs, and their application to problems of maintaining privacy and security in computer networks (such as digital signatures and key management). You will also understand - at a deep, technical level - ideas such as identity, authentication, and verfiability.

You wil also learn to appreciate societal issues as balancing individual privacy concerns against the needs of law enforcement, vulnerability of societal institutions to electronic attack, export regulations and international competitiveness, and development of secure information systems.

Requirements (Reading List and other materials)
I will provide detailed lecture notes covering everything you need. Any other content/textbooks will be either optional or available for free on the internet.
