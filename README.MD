### Overview
This course presents an **in-depth study of cryptography** and its applications to information and computer security. It serves as an **introduction to modern cryptography**, emphasizing its classical goals: **data privacy, authenticity, and integrity**. It covers the fundamentals of both **symmetric-key** and **public-key cryptography**. Additionally, the course introduces advanced cryptography concepts, including:

- Commitment schemes
- Secret sharing
- Oblivious transfer
- Zero-knowledge proofs
- Multi-party computation

Cryptography lies at the center of this course but is approached broadly. Highlights include:

- **Computer and information security problems** and how cryptographic tools solve them.
- **Social issues** surrounding cryptography.
- **Mathematical structures** behind cryptographic primitives.
- **Real-world applications** of cryptographic techniques.

#### Key Themes:
1. **Information Security:**
   - Controlling the dissemination of information.
   - Privacy, data integrity, authenticity, and authority.

2. **Logical Controls:**
   - Cryptography as a tool for logical controls, independent of physical device properties.

3. **Broader Security Topics:**
   - Physical security, access restrictions, activity monitoring, and control of software defects.
